This project is called "band name generator".
It asks for your pet name and the city you grew up in to create band name for you. 
This project displays the understanding of:
a).  taking input from the user and managing it.
b).  reading a file from the system and using its content
c).  manipulating strings
d).  the logic of string comparison and storing it in a data structure.
I learned a lot of other things too from the bugs encountered while trying to run the program on my system. Like configuring the editor to run the version
of python(3.8.10) that I need, different ways to compare strings according to the need, different text reading methods from a file, striping the extra content
from the required text from the file.
